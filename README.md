## UX
My Considerations for the website:

Car Buyers 
_Considerations :_  
- they must be able to view and make purchase for a vehicle listing by placing a deposit

Car Sellers
_Considerations :_  
- they must be able to view, add, edit and delete a vehicle listing
- they need a channel to market their car to attract buyer

## Technologies

## Features
The page will show the full listing from the database by default

My Design of the site:
- User have to login before he can start posting or make purchase for any vehicles
- User can register 
- User can log out
- User can use credit card to place a deposit for the vehicle
- User can add a vehicle listing by clicking on the ADD button on top left
- User can edit or delete the listing by click on the 2 link on the right of the listing
- User can use the search bar to do search for the car they looking for; they can search using 1-4 options combine

_Limitations & Future development:_
Profile of User will show transaction history and vehicle/s listed by the User
Click on the selected vehicle will reveal more details about the vehicle (part of future development)
